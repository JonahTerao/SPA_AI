Overview:

1. To generate a random island

Features/Functionality
1. Clearly label and show the terrain
2. A button to generate islands
3. Sliders to increase complexity and size

Issues
1. Text labeling north below the compass has remained after constant arguments with multiple GPTs
2. A scale that doesn't seem to provide the user any context
3. long wait times
4. mountains and forests frequency are low

Future ideas
1. Zoom function
2. increasing range of forests and mountains
